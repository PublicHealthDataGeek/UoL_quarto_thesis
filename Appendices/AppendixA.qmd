## Exclusion criteria for OpenStreetMap highways

We started with the OSM lines dataset. We removed any non-highways OSM
lines that were coded as: "dam", "lock_gate", "gate", "handrail" or
"fence".

We removed any highways that were coded as:

-   Footway

-   Steps

-   Elevator

-   Track (this is off road, mainly for agricultural vehicles)

-   Proposed (as this means they have not been built)

-   Construction (as this means they are under construction)

-   Bridleways (as this as usually off road tracks for horse riders)

We removed any highways where the surface was coded as:

-   Gravel, fine gravel, grit or loose-surface

-   Dirt

-   Grass or grass-paver
