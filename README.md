# University of Leeds Quarto thesis template

I generated this template to support other UoL students who may wish to write their PhD thesis in quarto. It meets the requirements for the UoL PhD thesis submission as of 2023.    

It was derived from the excellent quarto-thesis template created by Dr Eli Holmes.  Her original repo is here:   
https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis

The pdf of the what these template files generate available in this repo as *"Put-your-Phd_title-here.pdf"*  

You may need to follow her instructions [here](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis) to get it to work on your laptop. 
Or it may just work if you clone this repo. She has a [Video](https://youtu.be/smzNQtogSaI) here on how to clone her repo, install a new R project and then render the thesis.
